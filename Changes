    Features
    - fork_ok() now returns the PID of the forked process just like fork().
    * Added some better diagnostics about what fork_ok() is doing.

    Bug Fixes
    * Fixed a race condition causing the reaper to wait for kids which have already
      been reaped.

    Tests
    - Add a test for the case when fork() fails.
    - Improve the test to ensure test numbers get turned back on after the
      children are all done.
